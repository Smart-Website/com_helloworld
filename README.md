Hello World Component for Joomla 3.x

I was trying to work through the documentation to learn how to create my own component for Joomla 3.x from the official documentation located here:
http://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Developing_a_MVC_Component/Developing_a_Basic_Component

Unfortunately, the process was a bit confusing. I can verify that step two and step ten fail when installed directly from the archives that have been previously published here:
https://github.com/joomla/Joomla-3.2-Hello-World-Component

When looking through the issues associated with that repo, it seemed that the only concrete advice was 'If you can figure out how to make it work, you're on your way'. That was not exactly the answer I was looking for.

So I decided that if I had to figure it out for myself, I was going to also learn how to incorporate it with GitHub as well. This type of project is perfect to learn both simultaneously.

One major addition to this version is that it has incorporated the Auto Update feature to the component. In order to test the functionality of this feature, the Update Branch will be the one that will be used as the Update Server. The intent is to create individual branches for the 10 steps. Once each step has been completed it will be merged into the Uaster Branch. This should allow the auto updater to work properly and keep the ansullary files (readme, gitignore, etc.) from the Update Server. Hopefully...

At this point in time, I am unsure if I am going to work through the documentation verbatim or make some of the changes that were recommended in the original repo.

Thanks to everyone who put together the original documentation. I'll be using it to base the changes on.

Stay tuned...
